create screen that : 
- snapshot of screen and explanation
- ballot format needs to be well defined
- need to work closely with team 8 to get ballot format
- needs to look beautiful
- methods that screen controller will provide ~~ ex. accepts proposition, displays on screen, captures the vote, reutrns proposition back, need to make sure you can go back, provide API methods that 
- election official mode vs voter mode (how each of these connect to API)

TODO: 
- create GUI based off ballot structure (both voter and official mode) 
- write methods that screen will provide to API (how we get input to screen back to API)
