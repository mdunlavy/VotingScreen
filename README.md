create screen that : 
- snapshot of screen and explanation
- ballot format needs to be well defined
- need to work closely with team 8 to get ballot format
- needs to look beautiful
- methods that screen controller will provide ~~ ex. accepts proposition, displays on screen, captures the vote, reutrns proposition back, need to make sure you can go back, provide API methods that 
- election official mode vs voter mode (how each of these connect to API)

TODO: 
- create GUI based off ballot structure (both voter and official mode) 
- we need to have a start screen, end screen, maybe once they're done we have a button that says "new voter" 
- write methods that screen will provide to API (how we get input to screen back to API)


do we need to write methods to take input from ballot or can we just create an example that we make up for our demo? 
do we need to create the screens for starting an election? not just turning on but actually activating it? or can we assume that an election is "started" through the card that is put in?
